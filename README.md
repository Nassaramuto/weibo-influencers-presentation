# Tracking Weibo Influencers

This talk was presented at Open Data Shanghai, hosted by Techyizu / CoderBunker / Agora Space / Patsnap, on 16 Dec 2016. (We came 1st place!)

Due to license of the dataset, this repo only has the simple python/pandas script we used to clean and split the data, and does NOT include the dataset itself. 

### Stack
- Python, Panda.
